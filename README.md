## Introduction

This is a simple Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself. The game ends when the snake runs into its own body.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install Pygame:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
  - **Left Arrow**: Move left
  - **Right Arrow**: Move right
  - **Up Arrow**: Move up
  - **Down Arrow**: Move down

- The goal is to eat the green food blocks that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer.

- The game ends if the snake collides with its own body.
